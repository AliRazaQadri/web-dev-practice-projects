  <h1>Scope of <b>Web Development</b> vs <b>AI/Data Science</b></h1>

  <p>
    In today’s <i>digital world</i>, two fields dominate the tech industry: 
    <strong>Web Development</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Data Science</strong>.  
    Both have <em>massive career opportunities</em>, but the choice depends on skills, interests, and goals.

  <h2>1. What is <abbr title="World Wide Web Development">Web Development</abbr>?</h2>
  <p>
    <dfn>Web Development</dfn> is the process of building websites and web applications.  
    It covers <b>frontend</b> (user interface), <b>backend</b> (server, database), and 
    <b>full stack</b> (both).  
    Example: <q>A beautifully designed website is useless if it lacks strong backend support.</q>
  </p>

  <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/">
    According to <cite>MDN Web Docs</cite>, web development is one of the most in-demand IT fields globally.
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li><ins>High Demand Jobs</ins> in software houses, startups, and global companies</li>
    <li><del>Limited freelancing opportunities</del> → Actually, freelancing is a huge earning source</li>
    <li><s>Outdated technology</s> → Modern frameworks like <b>React</b>, <b>Node.js</b> keep it evolving</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> / Data Science?</h2>
  <p>
    <dfn>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</dfn> is about building machines that 
    <em>think and learn</em> like humans.  
    <dfn>Data Science</dfn> deals with analyzing large datasets to find patterns.  
    Together, they power <b>smart applications</b> like chatbots, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> → Computers learn without being explicitly programmed</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> → Uses neural networks like brain neurons</li>
    <li><strong>Big Data Analytics</strong> → Handling terabytes (10<sup>12</sup> bytes) of data</li>
    <li><strong>Statistics</strong> → Probability, regression, and other math models (H<sub>2</sub>O.ai is an example platform)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Career & Earning Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    Both fields offer <b>excellent earning potential</b>.  
    A <ins>web developer</ins> can earn from 
    <strong>$500 – $3000+</strong> monthly through freelancing, while 
    <ins>AI/Data Science engineers</ins> often start with salaries around 
    <strong>$2000 – $6000+</strong> in international markets.  
  </p>

  <p>
    However, AI requires <em>more math, statistics, and coding skills</em>, while Web Development is 
    comparatively easier to start and quicker to earn from.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
  <p>
    The decision depends on your passion:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you love <em>designing websites, coding in JavaScript, and creating apps</em> → Go for <b>Web Development</b></li>
    <li>If you enjoy <em>mathematics, logic, and solving data problems</em> → Choose <b>AI & Data Science</b></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Both <b>Web Development</b> and <b>AI/Data Science</b> have 
    <em>bright futures</em>.  
    If you want <ins>quick income</ins>, start with web development.  
    If you want to build a <strong>long-term high-tech career</strong>, explore AI and Data Science.
